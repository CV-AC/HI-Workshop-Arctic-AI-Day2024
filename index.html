    <h1>Call for Participation</h1>
    <h2>Hybrid Intelligence Workshop <a href="https://www.oulu.fi/en/events/arctic-ai-day-2024">@Arctic AI Day 2024</a></h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The workshop on Hybrid Intelligence seeks to address the increasingly vital intersection of human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI), exploring the synergistic potential that arises from their integration. This emerging field, often referred to as Hybrid Intelligence, is not merely about enhancing AI capabilities but about creating systems that leverage the unique strengths of both human cognition and machine learning. The workshop aims to convene researchers, practitioners, and scholars from various disciplines to engage in the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and ethical implications of this integration, fostering a rich transdisciplinary dialogue.</p>
    <p>At the heart of Hybrid Intelligence is the recognition that while AI excels in processing vast amounts of data and performing tasks with speed and precision, human intelligence brings creativity, emotional understanding, and ethical reasoning to the table. The fusion of these capabilities has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of fields, from education and healthcare to business and public policy. However, realizing this potential requires a deep understanding of the cognitive and computational models that underlie both human and machine intelligence. The workshop will explore these theoretical frameworks, drawing from cognitive science, psychology, computer science, learning sciences, and other relevant fields to develop a comprehensive understanding of how these different forms of intelligence can be harmonized.</p>
    <p>The transdisciplinary nature of Hybrid Intelligence necessitates collaboration across a wide range of fields. This workshop is designed to facilitate such collaboration, encouraging participants from different disciplines to share their perspectives, methodologies, and findings. By bringing together diverse expertise, the workshop aims to foster new research partnerships and inspire innovative approaches to the development and application of Hybrid Intelligence. </p>


    
    <h3>Call for Participation</h3>
    <p>We invite researchers, practitioners, educators, and others interested in the emerging field of Hybrid Intelligence to submit a research abstract for a pitch presentation. Submissions may present a novel idea, a work in progress, a recently published study, or a vision for a specific area within Hybrid Intelligence. It is essential that each submission clearly articulates and positions the research direction or need in relation to Hybrid Intelligence. The submission should be directed towards one of the following three main themes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Trust and AI</li>
        <li>Multimodal Data Collection & Analytics for Hybrid Intelligence</li>
        <li>Emotion and Cognition AI</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Program Committee will review all submissions, and selected presentations will serve as a catalyst for initiating shared conversations throughout the workshop. We anticipate that these research pitches (and optional posters) will provide valuable input, shaping the visions and future research and development directions for Hybrid Intelligence.</p>


    <h3>Themes</h3>
    <h4>1. Trust and AI</h4>
    <p>One of the challenges in developing truly hybrid intelligence is understanding how to build and maintain socio-technical systems which are both trustworthy and trusted appropriately. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, trust becomes more complex, and less and less about trusting a tool to function well. However, there are still differences between trusting AI and trusting another person. There are many perspectives on trust from philosophy, psychology, social sciences, computer science and human-computer interaction. This theme aims to bring together all researchers interested in trust in AI, trust by AI, and trustworthy AI.</p>
    <h4>2. Multimodal Data Collection & Analytics for Hybrid Intelligence</h4>
    <p>Humans express themselves verbally, vocally, and visually. One of the challenges in developing hybrid intelligence is building automated systems that can perceive the complexity in human behaviors and interactions. Collecting data is an important step in the pipeline. There are various dimensions of consideration when it comes to collecting multimodal human data. To name a few, how do we preserve naturalness in human behaviors while collecting data? How much data is enough? What are the practical and ethical issues related to data collection and sharing? The assumptions and design choices made during data collection have a direct impact on downstream analysis and methods development. This theme aims to invite all researchers interested in multimodal AI, multimedia analysis, and machine learning and pattern recognition for human behaviors.</p>
    <h4>3. Emotion and Cognition AI</h4>
    <p>Human cognition and emotion are deeply intertwined, and understanding this relationship is critical to advancing AI that can effectively interact with humans. This theme explores the intersection of AI with emotional and cognitive processes, aiming to create systems that can perceive, interpret, and even respond to human emotional or cognitive states. A key challenge in this area is developing models that can emulate human-like reasoning and emotional responses. Questions in this theme include: How can we teach AI to recognize and appropriately react to emotional cues in human communication? What role do emotional intelligence and cognitive empathy play in human-AI interaction? Furthermore, it opens discussions on the ethical implications of emotionally aware AI systems and their potential in applications like mental health, education, and personalized user experiences. This theme invites researchers working at the frontier of affective computing, emotion recognition, cognitive AI, and human-centered AI systems.</p>

    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>We ask participants to submit an extended abstract of 1-2 pages (excluding references) describing their research focus in the area of hybrid intelligence. The position paper should provide a summary of the research focus, or a relevant selection of the research focus if this is more applicable to the field of HI. Position papers should also provide suggestions on discussion topics that can be brought up during the sessions of the workshop. Please also explicitly relate the paper to one of the three main themes, as described above. Authors are asked to pick one main theme, although papers can, of course, align with others as well. Submissions are meant to kickstart and guide the discussions on the day, and introduce researchers to the workshop attendees, so accepted submissions will be invited for a short talk, and can bring a poster if they wish so.</p>
    <p>Please ensure that your submission follows the IOS Press format, as outlined in their official guidelines. Detailed instructions can be found at the following link: IOS Press Submission Instructions. This includes adhering to specific requirements regarding document structure, layout, references, and figure formatting. Submissions that do not comply with these guidelines may be returned for revision.</p>
